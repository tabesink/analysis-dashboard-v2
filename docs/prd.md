# Product Requirements Document

**Product:** RSP Data Analytics Dashboard  
**App version:** 1.3.7  
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-21

---

## 1. Product Overview

A full-stack data analytics dashboard for uploading, filtering, and visualizing automotive suspension component test data. Engineers upload CSV or RSP test files, apply multi-dimensional filters, and view downsampled time-series plots in a configurable grid or interactive canvas. Admins manage users and permissions, filter options, custom fields, and load-data portability between hosts.

Production deployments use a Docker release bundle with a single-origin LAN proxy. The live database is one DuckDB file; admins can export load data for portability between managed databases.

## 2. Users

| Role | Write access | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Read-only user** | No (`can_write=false`) | Login/register, browse Dashboard, apply filters, view plots, manage own session. Database and Edit Filters nav items are disabled. |
| **Writer** (`can_write=true`) | Yes | All read-only capabilities + upload CSV/RSP with channel maps, edit event metadata (own rows or as permitted), manage channel maps, scope delete for owned program/version groups. |
| **Admin** | Always | All writer capabilities + user management (`/settings/users`), filter option administration, custom fields, per-event **Status** updates, load-data export, database create/connect/delete, purge soft-deleted data. |

Self-service **registration** creates read-only accounts by default. Admins grant write access per user on the Settings page.

## 3. Core Workflows

```
Upload CSV/RSP + channel_map.yaml
  --> ETL: parse (RSP conversion when needed), validate, transform (wide-to-long), LTTB downsample
  --> Store: dim_event + measurements_raw + measurements_lttb + dim_channel_map
  --> Cache invalidation + data_version bump

Filter & Select Events (unified Load Data panel)
  --> Global filters (15 built-in dimensions + custom fields)
  --> Program / version / event hierarchical tree (channel-map gated selection)
  --> Status still filters semantics (Approved, Obsolete, Pending) but no separate baseline/new partitions

Render Plots
  --> Grid mode: multi-plot SVG grid with LTTB-downsampled data
  --> Interactive mode: single-plot canvas with pan/zoom
  --> Color coding by version, filter value, or per-event
  --> Group-level axis sync (Bushing vs BJ/Shock plot groups)

Session Persistence
  --> Server-synced session state (filters, rendered events, UI preferences)
  --> Client-side sessionStorage backup
  --> Debounced sync

Cross-User Refresh
  --> Authenticated clients poll GET /api/v1/sync/version
  --> When data_version increases, invalidate event catalogs, filters, program/version lists
  --> Polling pauses during active folder uploads

Load-Data Portability (admin)
  --> Export: background Parquet ZIP (load-data tables only)
  --> Import API endpoints are legacy compatibility stubs and return 410 Gone
  --> Operators use export + create/connect workflow for managed database transitions
```

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Upload

- Accept CSV files, `.rsp` files (converted via channel map), or folders via a single drag-and-drop control
- Require `channel_map.yaml` defining plot channels (or complete channel-map setup for pending uploads)
- Support RSP-format CSV with `#DATA`/`#TITLES` markers
- Validate: duplicate file hash detection, NaN percentage limits, row count limits, channel map index checks, timestamp monotonicity
- Metadata fields: program_id, version, status, RFQ/DV/PV/Post-Prod applicability booleans, suspension_component, axle_location, raw weight fields (GVW/FGAWR/RGAWR) with derived range buckets for filtering, drive_type, material_construction, steering_position, damper_type, vehicle_type, job_number, work_order
- Custom field values can be attached per event during upload
- Transactional ingestion: all-or-nothing per file
- LTTB downsampling computed and stored during ingestion
- Creator-scoped upload progress over SSE with durable task state
- Dataset listing with server-side pagination and column facets

### 4.2 Filtering

- 15 built-in filter dimensions defined in `server/schema.yaml` (including RFQ/DV/PV/Post-Prod booleans replacing legacy phase)
- Admin-defined custom fields with program-scoped allowed values
- Event ID search (substring match)
- Bidirectional filter propagation: filters constrain available programs/versions/events
- Server-side filter semantics module validates filter plans consistently across endpoints
- Weight range buckets applied in SQL against raw numeric columns
- Saved filter presets (per user)

### 4.3 Visualization

- Grid view: configurable plot grid rendering SVG plots from LTTB data
- Interactive view: single-plot canvas with full-resolution data, pan/zoom; falls back to rendered events when selection is empty
- Color modes: by version, by filter value, per-event custom colors
- Color legend panel (docked or floating)
- Pinned events for cross-status comparison
- Click-query: identify nearest curve at click coordinates
- Binary data transfer for large plot payloads (Web Worker decode)

### 4.4 Session Management

- Create/update/delete sessions via REST API
- JSON blob storage for filter state, rendered event IDs, UI preferences
- Session TTL with expiration
- User-scoped sessions (user_id binding)

### 4.5 Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based auth with httpOnly cookie transport
- bcrypt password hashing (minimum 8 characters)
- Closed login: accounts must exist (admin-created or self-registered)
- Route protection on frontend (redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`)
- Backend guards: `get_current_user`, `require_admin`, `require_write_or_admin`
- Admin-only: load-data export, database create/connect/delete, user CRUD, filter option admin, custom field definitions, event Status field, purge
- Settings (`/settings/users`) and Changelog (`/changelog`) in app shell; version label shows client/server versions and live vs target DB schema version

### 4.6 Load-Data Portability

- **Scope:** Export processed engineering data from the active managed database. Export artifacts are used with create/connect workflows; import is not a supported product operation.
- **Export (admin):** Background job writes load-data tables to Parquet (ZSTD), generates `schema.sql` / `load.sql`, zips as `dashboard_export.zip`; client polls task status then downloads the ZIP.
- **Legacy import API:** `POST .../parquet/upload`, `DELETE .../parquet/upload/{upload_id}`, and `POST .../parquet/import/{upload_id}` remain compatibility stubs and return `410 Gone` with replacement guidance.
- **API:** `POST /api/v1/export/database/parquet/export/start`, `GET .../parquet/task/{id}`, `GET .../parquet/download/{id}`, `GET .../database/info`
- Schema metadata (`_schema_metadata`) included for compatibility checks
- Optimistic concurrency: single-event metadata updates require `if_unmodified_since`; HTTP 409 when stale

See `docs/notes/database.md` and `Deployment/README.md` for operator details.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

| Timestamp monotonicity | Required | settings.yaml |

### 5.3 Security

- JWT with configurable expiry (default: 24h)
- Production: secrets from environment; `settings.yaml` is a dev template
- Secure cookie enforcement when not using trusted-LAN HTTP mode
- CORS restricted to configured origins
- `ADMIN_SECRET` bootstraps initial admin on first startup
- Rate limiting with burst allowance per endpoint category
- Ownership checks on metadata updates and scope deletes

## 6. Data Schema

See `docs/database-schema.txt` for the complete schema definition.

## 7. Known Limitations & Remaining Work

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Multi-user sync | **Shipped** — `data_version` polling, cache invalidation, optimistic metadata concurrency |
| Horizontal scaling | **Not supported** — single DuckDB file, single writer; see `docs/architecture/deployment-and-scaling.md` |
| HTTPS / secure cookies in LAN bundle | Operator choice — use `ALLOW_INSECURE_COOKIES` only on trusted networks |
| Frontend E2E (Playwright) | Not yet implemented |
| Full backend unit coverage (ETL, cache) | Partial — see `docs/test-strategy.md` |
| Responsive / mobile layout | Desktop-first; not optimized for small screens |
| Dark mode | CSS hook present; tokens not defined |

See Phase 8–9 and backlog in `docs/master-build-plan.md` for tracked follow-ups.
