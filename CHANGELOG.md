# Changelog


## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Database scope delete confirmation and progress modal: admins see a scope summary before delete, a blocking phased progress dialog during long program/version hard-deletes, and a completion summary with counts and elapsed time. UI follows shadcn.io `dialog-bulk-actions`, `dialog-confirm-delete`, `dialog-loading`, and `dialog-success` block patterns.
- **PUT** `/api/v1/dashboard/program-version/schedule` to persist edited durability schedule table rows (`event_rows`, `multiplier`, `delimiter_token`) on the active schedule preview metadata without re-uploading `.sch` bytes; audits `DURABILITY_SCHEDULE_EDITED`.
- Editable Durability Schedule tab: inline row editing, Save/Reset with dirty tracking, hydration from saved `event_rows` on GET, and readonly mode for non-write users.
- Pure client durability schedule row matcher (`discoverEventDelimiter`, `rspEventNameFromFile`, `matchSchedulePattern`, `buildDurabilityScheduleRows`) aligned with `rsp_file_name_extraction_v2.ipynb` — delimiter discovery, longest-substring pattern match, and unit tests for PRD fixture filenames.
- Durability schedule attach/read API regression tests covering GET active context, POST validation (empty/non-`.sch`), admin cross-owner attach, identical checksum dedupe, and parser edge cases (`*summary`, missing metadata defaults, zero repeats).
- **Settings** modal dialog (sidebar icon): two-column layout with **User Management** and **Database** panels. User Management preserves admin CRUD (role, write access, password reset). Database panel embeds Transfer Data actions (create, connect, export, import).
- Inspect Damage calculates per-event fatigue damage for the 12 canonical channels derived from the existing plot channel map.
- CSV and RSP uploads now retain immutable original file bytes under managed `artifacts/sources/` with SHA-256 checksums and portable `artifact://` URIs recorded in `source_artifacts`.
- CSV and RSP uploads now derive canonical CSV artifacts under `artifacts/canonical/` with ingestion-run audit records and per-event lineage links.
- YAML and UI channel-map authoring now normalize into immutable snapshots under `artifacts/snapshots/` with one active snapshot per program/version and per-event snapshot lineage.
- Each ingested event now stores lightweight preview metadata (headers, units, sample rows, counts, warnings, artifact references) derived from canonical CSV in `event_previews`.
- Derived measurement and LTTB rows now record explicit lineage to canonical CSV and channel-map snapshots in `event_derived_data`; LTTB is classified as plot-only data; Pending events are marked stale when the active snapshot changes.
- Admin database export now produces a transfer package with `manifest.json`, lineage Parquet tables, and portable `artifacts/` files (sources, canonical CSV, snapshots, schedules). Import validates artifact checksums and rejects missing references before applying data.

### Changed
- Uploads without `channel_map.yaml` now create `dim_event` rows immediately (CSV and RSP) while retaining pending artifacts for later channel-map setup and measurement generation in Edit Metadata.
- Upload, delete, and database transfer dialogs now use a compact 32px status badge with 16px icons and avoid repeating the header title inside summaries.
- Database folder import now shows progress and completion in a blocking operation dialog (matching scope delete and DB import/export), instead of inline progress in the upload side panel.
- Identical durability schedule re-upload (same checksum already active for the program/version) is now a silent no-op with no duplicate audit log entry.
- Folder uploads now poll DuckDB-backed task status instead of relying on SSE, so long ingests complete reliably even when the progress stream disconnects.
- Admin database export now uses the transfer package format; legacy load-data-only archives without `manifest.json` can still be imported.
- Sidebar settings control renamed from "Admin settings" to **Settings**; opens a modal instead of navigating to `/settings/users`.
- `/settings/users` bookmarks redirect to the dashboard and open the User Management panel in the settings dialog.
- Inspect Damage now uses canonical column labels such as `BJ X Force` and `Bushing F Z Momt`, backed by existing `measurements_raw` plot-channel rows.

### Fixed
- Folder upload task polling and dataset list refresh no longer hit the strict upload write rate limit (429) during long ingests.
- Switching to another managed database no longer forces users to recreate accounts or log back in.
- Connecting to a different database no longer shows stale program/version dropdowns from the previous database on Edit Metadata (server query cache is cleared on switch; client data queries are invalidated).
- Large folder uploads no longer report false "Upload stream error" failures when server ingestion succeeds but the browser loses the SSE connection (for example during auth redirect mid-upload).

### Security
- Program-version metadata updates (`PUT /api/v1/dashboard/program-version/metadata`) now require write permission; read-only users can no longer bypass the edit-page route guard via direct API calls.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Staging Parquet import tunes DuckDB for large ZIPs: `preserve_insertion_order=false`, single-threaded load, 10GB staging memory limit (configurable), and a reduced live-connection cap during import.
- Docker server `mem_limit` increased to 12 GiB to match multi-gigabyte measurement imports.
- Load-data export/import now omits retained raw CSV/RSP artifacts and `ingestion_artifacts`, so portable ZIPs carry processed load data only and legacy `managed_artifacts` entries are skipped during import.
- Deployment docs clarify disk vs RAM after artifact exclusion: plan for extracted Parquet tables, staging DB, backup, and scratch margin rather than retained raw files.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Parquet import/export task status is persisted under `data/tmp/parquet-tasks` so polling survives API restarts; orphaned running tasks are marked failed on startup.
- Large imports now load into an isolated `dashboard.db.staging` file and atomically replace the live database only after success, so a crash or segfault during load no longer leaves a partial `dashboard.db`. Load-data tables commit per table to reduce peak memory.
- Docker server healthcheck uses `/health/live` instead of `/health/ready` so DuckDB probes do not run against a locked database during import.

### Fixed
- Import UI no longer shows only “task state no longer available” when the server restarts mid-import: it recovers persisted task status or compares live event counts to the archive when possible.
- Readiness returns immediately while a background import is active, avoiding healthcheck hangs during heavy Parquet loads.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Database import backup step reports byte-level progress during `dashboard.db` copy and shows clearer copy in the import dialog while backing up.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Database import progress now reports backup, load-data, and finalization phases, retries transient server gateway errors during heavy imports, and pauses background data-version polling while an import is active.

### Fixed
- Changelog page loads in production Docker images (`CHANGELOG.md` is bundled at `/app/CHANGELOG.md`).
- React hydration error (#418) from nested `<main>` elements in the app shell layout.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- LAN Docker proxy now streams large database import uploads to the API instead of buffering them on the proxy's small cache tmpfs, and the compressed import upload limit is now 60 GiB end-to-end.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Production Docker import/export now stages large Parquet ZIP temp files under `data/tmp` on the persistent data volume instead of the server container’s 128 MB `/tmp` tmpfs (fixes HTTP 500 on multi‑hundred‑MB uploads after the nginx body-size fix).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- LAN Docker proxy now allows large database import uploads (`client_max_body_size` aligned with API `max_upload_size_mb`; extended API proxy timeouts for multi-GB ZIP uploads).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Cross-user data refresh: authenticated sessions poll for database changes and automatically refresh event catalogs, filters, and program/version lists.
- Admin-only Load Data Transfer section on the Database page for Parquet ZIP export and import.
- Version label in the header now shows client/server versions plus live and target database schema versions.

### Changed
- Event metadata updates require the row's last-modified token and return HTTP 409 when another user changed the same event first.
- Filter dropdowns and event listings now share validated server-side filter semantics for consistent results.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Production startup now reconciles declared schema DDL before runtime backfills, fixing crash loops on legacy databases missing `users.can_write`.
- Docker production server sets `MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/matplotlib` so matplotlib cache writes work on read-only root filesystems.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Direct `.rsp` uploads in the Database panel, converting them through the existing channel-map-based ingestion flow.
- Env-primary production deployment files with a one-shot LAN deployment script and version/schema status visibility.

### Changed
- Database upload now uses a single drag-and-drop import control instead of separate file and folder buttons.
- The committed server settings file is now a development template; production secrets are expected from environment variables.

### Security
- Parquet ZIP import now rejects unsafe archive paths before extraction to keep failed imports inside managed temporary directories.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Creator-scoped CSV upload progress over SSE with DuckDB-backed task state for durable progress visibility.
- Dataset listing pagination metadata (`total`, `limit`, `offset`, `has_more`) plus server-side global facets for filter dropdowns.
- Unified `Load Data` panel that replaces the historical/new-data split and simplifies event selection/caching behavior.
- Group-level axis sync in the plot grid so Bushing plots sync independently from BJ/Shock plots.
- Release governance tooling around root `VERSION` sync (`release_version.py`, `check_version_sync.py`, CI drift checks).

### Changed
- Database export/import UI block is temporarily hidden in the Database side panel while preserving backend portability endpoints.
- Interactive Viewer now falls back to rendered events when selected events are empty, reducing false "No curves visible" states after navigation.
- Dashboard side panel now scrolls as one column, and `Load Data` participates in shared panel scrolling to avoid nested-scroll clipping.
- Upload `Status` defaults to `Pending`, remains visible for all users, and is role-locked in the UI for non-admin users.
- Database hardening boundaries: upload dataset reads moved behind `UploadQueryService`, dashboard event username enrichment owned by service layer, and frontend event-loading contracts aligned with backend filters.
- Session API client payload typing now aligns with backend session models.

### Fixed
- Export-task polling and long-running database operations no longer fail from mixed DuckDB connection modes or stale connection handles (`ConnectionException` / `bad_weak_ptr` race path).
- Metadata update workflows now enforce service-layer ownership checks, audit logging, cache invalidation, and shared weight-range derivation with fewer router/service drift risks.
